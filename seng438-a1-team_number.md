# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual functional testing before this lab:

By participating in lab 1 for SENG 438 - Introduction to Testing and Defect Tracking - our group dove head first into what it's like to test software for bugs, especially without any special guidance. From other classes, most of us had the experience of writing coded unit tests themselves to test specific functionalities within code. By conducting these tests, we've learned different methods to track bugs and observe if they have been resolved.

Prior to this lab, the majority of us had no idea what 'exploratory' testing was. Before approaching the software, we were confused, wondering if we were doing it correctly. Realizing that the main idea of 'exploratory' testing is to create and execute tests as we go, we got more comfortable doing so.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

For our exploratory testing, the test charter we agreed on was to 'determine if the program meets all specified requirements.' We aimed to target all functions by using team exploratory testing and employed the "tour bus" principle, a term coined by Cem Kaner. This principle outlines that a general plan is drawn up and the tester tries out more things when undesired behavior is seen. We planned to test all functions briefly and delve deeper when any bugs were noticed by trying to recreate the bug with a different order of steps. We decided to test the most common paths as well as exceptional paths. Below you can see our test coverage outline:

Customer interaction 

- Wrong card number
- Pin validation 
- Bank inquiries 
- 3 invalid pins 

Transaction services

- Cash withdrawals (from chequing and savings) 
- Cash deposits 
- Cash transfers

Error Handling

- Canceling a transaction mid-way
- Withdrawing an amount larger than available 
- Withdrawing from an empty account

The outline specifies 3 broad categories we wanted to cover and specific use cases within each.


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# How the pair testing was managed and teamwork/effort was divided 

For exploratory testing, our group broke into pairs. The tester was responsible for guiding the testing and the other partner took on the role of a recorder, they noted down each action taken by the tester at every point. When a bug was found, both the tester and recorder worked together to note the bug down using AzureDevOps.

For manual testing, the group worked together. One person used the program, one organized the order to perform tests, one recorded any bugs found in AzureDevOps and the last member double-checked all bugs to ensure no duplicates were seen.

For regression testing, we split the 40 manual tests as well as the number of bugs found in version 1.0 amongst ourselves (15 tests/member) and recorded any new defects.

Overall, we agreed the work load and effort were split evenly.
